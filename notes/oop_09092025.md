# object oriented programming (java) sept 9, 2025

## data hiding
- restricting something idk

## example without encapsulation
- both fields are public
  - name and grade
- anyone can directly assign any value to grade
- problem: nothing prevents us from setting an invalid grade like -10 or 200

## example with encapsulation
- now the fields are marked private
- instead, we provide public methods such as
  - `setGrade(int g)` -> validates before assigning
  - `getGrade()` -> safely retrieves the value
- this ensures grades are always between 0 and 100

## encapsulation
-

## constructors and overloading
- a constructor is a special method to initialize objevts
- it has same name as class (a contstructor must have the exact same name as the class it belongs to)
- no return type
- constructor is called automatically when you create an object
    
    ### example

    - when we write <br>
    `student s = new`
    `Student("Alice", 90)`

- idk this was all covered in gr12 just read up on it and practice
