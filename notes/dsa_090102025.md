## preprocessor stuff

- for macros, always have brackets around the actual value you're working with due to operator precedence
- like if you have
    ```c
    a = x + 1
    b = y - 2
    ```
    you'll run into stuff like this where
    ```c
    #define foo(a, b) a > b
    ```
    which expands to
    ```c
    x + 1 > y - 2
    ```
    and you might run into issues with the order of which each operator gets evaluated

- always remember to not overwrite your source code by putting your source file(s) after the -o flag
- read up on .i files

## compiler stuff
- gcc and clang are both single pass compilers
- for example
    ```c
    int main() {
        foo();//can't do this because the compiler doens't know what foo is yet
    }

    int foo() {
        return 0;
    }
    ```
