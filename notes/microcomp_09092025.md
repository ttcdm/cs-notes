## notes for microcomp self study
- pc (`program counter`) stores the address of the next instruction to be executed and not the current address of the instruction that's being executed. it also gets incremented by the size of the current instruction that was fetched
- the instruction cycle consists of 3 steps which are fetch, decode, and execute
- understand read vs load and their semantic differences ig
- 5 components essential to computer architecture is datapath, control, memory, input, and output
- compilers usually compile straight to machine code instead of asm?? obviously there's the intermediary language but yea
