## setters and getters in java
- set value (mutator)
- get value
- idk man just write some java
## static and instance vars
  - basically instance is for each instance (object) created from the class and static is for the class only if that makes sense
  - like a global variable that pertains to every single object and it's the same throughout. race conditions may arise???
  - js write java bruh
